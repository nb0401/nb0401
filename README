Hello, Iâ€™m @nb0401ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a thirst for challenges. Coming from a creative background, conception and production of audiovisual media, public relations, and marketing management, I eternalized communicating stories as a key aspect of my past. Now I want to connect my skills with an intellectual challenge in the work of a Data Analyst/Scientist. My eagerness to learn and my high frustration tolerance let me enjoy pressure situations with calmness and ease, making me a reliable and supportive colleague. Iâ€™m passionate about interacting with data to squeeze out any insight bit by bit - making it about whatâ€™s possible with the data at hand.
