Hello, Iâ€™m @nb0401ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m currently in the Data Analytics Course at Career Foundry! I'm a Newbie at the subject, but I started to love data sets while working in a PR-Consulting agency and wanted to dig into this new opportunity! :)
My work on this course is the key aspect on github. You can find my work tasks from the course in the "Data-Analytics-Course"-Repository!

Iâ€™m currently learning Tableau. But besides Data Analytics my areas of interest range from graphic design/illustrations, music (I'm playing multiple instruments and record them as well), and programming which is timewise the smallest hobby I have for now, but I want to change that. :)


Iâ€™m keen to collaborate on anything regarding Data Analytics! For now that would be limited to Excel, but I'm looking into SQL and Python further down the line!
