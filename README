Hello, Iâ€™m @nb0401ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m currently in the Data Analytics Course at Career Foundry! I'm a Newbie at the subject, but I started to love data sets while working in a PR-Consulting agency and wanted to dig into this new opportunity! :)
My work on this course is the key aspect on github. You can find my work tasks from the course in the "Data-Analytics-Course"-Repository!

Currently there are two projects of this course in the repository:

1. A presentation about marketing recommendations in the video game sector for a fictive company using past sales data (up to 2016) for the next year (2017).

2. An interim report about the midterm findings of a project for a fictive medical staffing company regarding recommendations about where to send medical staff to support clinics and hospitals for the next influenza season in the US using past data. The key aspects were to find out which sort of population is the most vulnerable and in which states the most of these residents live. Using this knowledge to give a recommendation and a ranking for the US-States that can be used to send the medical staff.



Iâ€™m currently learning Tableau. But besides Data Analytics my areas of interest range from graphic design/illustrations, music (I'm playing multiple instruments and record them as well), and programming which is timewise the smallest hobby I have for now, but I want to change that. :)


Iâ€™m keen to collaborate on anything regarding Data Analytics! For now that would be limited to Excel, but I'm looking into SQL and Python further down the line!
